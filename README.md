# Micro-Bit-Radio-Messaging v1.1
Communicate with other Micro:Bits near you using the radio functions with the Micro:Bit. Messages will need to be edited by alterning the message in the code (find line 40 with the comment: "EDIT YOUR MESSAGE HERE"). Disclaimer: this source of communication is just for entertainment purposes and is NOT secure. Messages can be intercepted by listening in on the channel. 
# Messages are not encrypted!

# THIS CODE WORKS WITH AN LED!
Simply connect an LED, using crocodile clips, from P0 to the long leg (positive) of the LED and from the shorter leg (negative) of the LED to GND.

# Any ideas or criticism is welcome!
